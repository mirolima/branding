    <p>This is a Arcade City p-tag. We built this city, we built this city on rock an' roll. Built this city, we built this city on rock an' roll. Say you don't know me, or recognize my face. Say you don't care who goes to that kind of place. Knee deep in the hoopla, sinking in your fight. Too many runaways eating up the night.<br><br>

    Marconi plays the mamba, listen to the radio, don't you remember. We built this city, we built this city on rock an' roll</p>
